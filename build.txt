I do not use any build system and even makefiles because:
a. There is only one C file and two erl files to compile, no complex set
   of components bound by dependency relations.
b. A few distros, if any, have Sedna in their packages, so user anyway
   needs to manually specify locations of header and library files of Sedna's
   C driver. Also ei header and library files location may vary on different
   systems and their location needs to be somehow specified to compiler.
   The rest of dependensies is just a standard C library which is found
   by compiler in standard directories.
c. I wrote this for my purposes and learning GNU Autotools or CMake for only
   one program would be just a waist of time for me.
There are two binaries compiled - with and without logging. The one without
logging still creates logfile when run with "-log" argument, but writes nothing
to it.
The binary is compiled statically just because I like it more than using
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If you adhere this approach, you might need to install
a package named somewhat like "devel_libc_static_blahblahblah".
